## Motivation

As international students, We've witnessed firsthand the profound impact that the lack of infrastructure and support can have on the LGBTQIA+ community in our home countries. Many individuals face challenges in expressing their needs, finding understanding mentors, and accessing essential services that empower them to live authentically and with dignity.

This app is born out of a deep empathy for those who have struggled silently and a commitment to fostering a community where everyone can openly share their experiences, find solace in mentors who understand, and receive the support needed to thrive. It's a heartfelt endeavor to bridge the gaps, erase stigmas, and create a platform where the LGBTQIA+ community can stand united, resilient, and empowered.

Together, let's break down barriers, spark conversations, and build a world where every individual, regardless of their identity, can live a life of authenticity, acceptance, and happiness!
